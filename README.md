# Music Drops via Webscraping
I created this simple app to help me keep up with newly released hip-hop music. As the hip-hop director for my college's radio station, I'm responsible for kcompiling and distributing new release info to all of our DJs. I saw automating my information gathering process as a way to streamline and speed up my work. 

As of now, the app is pretty basic but I'm hoping to integrate some more features, such as work with the Spotify and Twitter APIs. As the project grows, I'll incorporate a PostgreSQL database to store info overtime and a dashboard to present info in a clean way.
